This repository is a collection of Python programming problems along with clear and well-structured solutions. The programs are designed to help beginners and students understand basic to intermediate Python concepts through practical implementation. Topics include core concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, file handling, data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries), hashing techniques, and basic object-oriented programming.
The problems are simple yet effective for:

* Practicing Python syntax and logic

* Strengthening understanding of data structures and algorithms

* Preparing for university practicals, class tests, or coding interviews

* Revising core Python concepts in a hands-on way


Each file is self-contained, beginner-friendly, and can be run independently. The code is commented where needed for better understanding. More problems will be added gradually, and contributions are welcome to make this a collaborative learning resource.
