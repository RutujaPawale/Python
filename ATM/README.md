Write a Python program to simulate basic ATM operations. Your program should do the following:

1. Display a menu with the following options:
  -Check Balance
  -Deposit Cash
  -Withdraw Cash
  -Exit

2. Set the initial account balance to ₹5000.

3. When the user selects:
  -Option 1: Display the current balance.
  -Option 2: Ask the user to enter the amount to deposit. Add it to the balance and display success message and updated balance.
  -Option 3: Ask the user to enter amount to withdraw. If sufficient balance is available, deduct and show updated balance; otherwise, display “Insufficient balance!”.
  -Option 4: Exit the program.

4. After every transaction (except exit), the program should display the menu again.

5. Use functions for each operation and ensure proper looping and error checking.
